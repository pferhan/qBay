# QBay
Quinnipiac's new buy/sell application that makes move in and move out hassel free!

## Why QBay?
Many students at Quinnipiac have items they want to buy or sell quickly, such as used textbooks, old dorm furniture, and more. Outside of using social media or other niche sources, there is no easy way to buy/sell items within the Quinnipiac circle. In order to remedy this, our team partnered with the university to develop a sharing space just for Quinnipiac students to use.

Buy, sell, or just browse, the choice is yours!
